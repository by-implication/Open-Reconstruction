Build notes:

If there are any changes made to the SQL evolutions, you must
have a PostgreSQL server running because of the code generation.
It assumes that you can get into the server with the username
postgres and password postgres. It then creates (and deletes)
a database named recon_gen and applies all the evolutions
so the code generator can inspect the tables.
