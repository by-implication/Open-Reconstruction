Open Reconstruction
====================

[Open Reconstruction](http://openreconstruction.gov.ph) is a project headed by the [Department of Budget and Management](http://dbm.gov.ph) in partnership with [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org.ph), in line with the [Open Data initiative](http://data.gov.ph). It aims to provide a means to NGAs/GOCCs/LGUs to easily **request for calamity funds** and keep track of the same as it goes through the **approval process**, ideally up until the **execution and implementation** of the project(s).

In addition, the site will also allow the **public** to track progress of projects and requests, **search and filter** these entries by location, type, or disaster, share these projects via social media, and leave comments on entries. **Reports, visualizations, and infographics** are also automatically generated by the system, based on real-time stats from the database.

## Technical Information

The Open Reconstruction system is a modern web application that follows the popular [single-page app architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). Pages are rendered in the browser by a JavaScript client,


## Data Sources

(TODO -- write up about where the data came from)

## Getting Started

You'll need the following services/frameworks installed on your machine or server to run your own instance of Open Recon:

* Java 6+ JDK (7 recommended)
* Play Framework 2.2.3
* Redis Server
* PostgreSQL 9.3+

The following tools should be accessible on your system's PATH:

* ImageMagick (for processing user-submitted images)
* PhantomJS (for SEO/social media indexing)
* SASS compiler

OR was developed on Mac and Windows machines, but we recommend using a Mac or Linux environment. (Linux especially for production.) If you are on Linux, all of these should be easily installed via your distro's package manager. On Mac, we suggest using Postgres.app, and Homebrew for everything else.

The client-side (in-browser) requirements are already included in the project, and are managed by Bower. In case you are curious, we use the following libraries:

* Mithril
* Leaflet
* d3
* c3
* jQuery
* underscore
* MutationObserver
* nprogress
* select2
* Font-Awesome
