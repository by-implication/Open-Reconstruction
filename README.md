Open Reconstruction
====================

Open Reconstruction ( **[openreconstruction.gov.ph](http://openreconstruction.gov.ph)** ) is a project headed by the [Department of Budget and Management](http://dbm.gov.ph) in partnership with the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org.ph), in line with the [Open Data initiative](http://data.gov.ph). It aims to provide a means to NGAs, GOCCs, and LGUs to easily **request for calamity funds** and keep track of the same as it goes through the **approval process**, ideally up until the **execution and implementation** of the project(s).

In addition, the site will also allow the **public** to track progress of projects and requests, **search and filter** these entries by location, type, or disaster, share these projects via social media, and leave comments on entries. **Reports, visualizations, and infographics** are also automatically generated by the system, based on real-time stats from the database.

## Technical Information

The Open Reconstruction (OR) system is a modern web application that follows the popular [single-page app architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). Pages are rendered in the browser by a JavaScript client, which communicates with a RESTful web backend written in Scala.

## Data Sources

(TODO -- write up about where the data came from, how we handle the data, etc.)

## Requirements + Setup

You'll need the following services/frameworks installed on your machine or server to run your own instance of OR:

* Java 6+ JDK (7 recommended)
* [Play Framework](http://playframework.com) 2.2.3
* [Redis](http://redis.io) Server
* PostgreSQL 9.3+

The following tools should be accessible on your system's PATH:

* ImageMagick (for processing user-submitted images) — ``convert``
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) (for SEO/social media indexing) — ``phantomjs``
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) compiler — ``sass``

If you're on **Linux**, all these should be easily installed via your distro's [package manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_management_system), like `apt-get`, `yum`, or `pacman`. On **Mac OS X**, we suggest using [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/), and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (`brew`).

The client-side (in-browser) requirements are already included in the project, and dependencies are (mostly) managed by [Bower](http://bower.io). In case you are curious, we use the following libraries:

* Mithril
* Leaflet
* d3
* c3
* jQuery
* underscore
* MutationObserver
* nprogress
* select2
* Font-Awesome
* Bourbon
* Foundation

## Getting Started

1. Make sure Postgres and Redis are running, and there exists a user/database for OR to connect to. DB configuration settings can be found in ``conf/application.conf``.
2. Make sure you have sample data for import in your Postgres data directory. (You can issue a ``show data_directory;`` from ``psql``.)
3. In the folder where you cloned OR, run ``play run`` to start OR in development mode.
